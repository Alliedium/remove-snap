# Remove snap from Ubuntu

This simple bash script removes snap from Ubuntu. Why? Because snap is severely broken and it completely messes up my servers. The content for this script came from an [Ask Ubuntu answer from Lorenz Keel](https://askubuntu.com/a/1285102/392607).

**Usage**

bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BryanDollery/remove-snap/main/remove-snap.sh)"
